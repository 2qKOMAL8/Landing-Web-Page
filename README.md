How Landing page is different from a Home Page?
The landing page is a single web page that appears in response to clicking on a search engine-optimized search result or any online advertisement and the Home page is the initial or the main web page of a website. The landing page acts as the front door to the website and the Home page acts as the expressway to the visitorâ€™s desired destination.

Style the layout created by HTML using CSS and link the CSS file to the HTML file.
